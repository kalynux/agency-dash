# Agent Location (read)

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — route, the PascalCase response shape and the 10-minute
TTL against `geo-tracker/internal/modules/location/`. **Two defects fixed**: the live position is
gated on Tracking Allow alone (not an active session), and a cookie-authenticated browser gets a
`502` here.

Last-known position for one agent, for callers that don't need a live stream
(a dashboard, or support tooling). This is the **live** position (Redis, updated
on every fix). GPS **ingestion** happens over the WebSocket, not here — see
[tracking-websocket.md](./tracking-websocket.md). For the *historical* trail (the
downsampled checkpoint history), see
[gps-persistence.md](./gps-persistence.md) and
`GET /tracking/sessions/{agentID}/checkpoints`.

## Authentication & authorization

`Authorization: Bearer <jovi-mall access token>`.

Authentication alone is **not** sufficient: this endpoint enforces the same
per-agent visibility rules as the WebSocket (see
[README.md](./README.md#authorization-model)). You may only read an agent whose
live location you are currently entitled to see — a vendor, or an agency with
no active shipment involving that agent, gets `404`.

### GET /locations/:agentID

**Response** (`200`):
```json
{
  "AgentID": "agent-1",
  "Position": { "latitude": 4.05, "longitude": 9.70 },
  "HeadingDegrees": 91.2,
  "SpeedMPS": 8.4,
  "RecordedAt": "2026-07-15T09:41:00Z",
  "ReceivedAt": "2026-07-15T09:41:01Z"
}
```

`RecordedAt` is the device's own timestamp for the fix; `ReceivedAt` is when
this service ingested it — compare against `RecordedAt` to judge staleness at
the source rather than by network arrival.

`HeadingDegrees` and `SpeedMPS` are **`null` when the device did not report
them** — they are not omitted from the object, so read them as nullable rather
than optional.

The whole body is the JSON literal `null` when the agent has no current position
(never reported, or the entry expired — positions live for **10 minutes** after
the last fix).

> ### ⚠ What gates this position: Tracking Allow ALONE — not a shipment
>
> Until 2026-09-08 this page said positions are recorded *"only while the agent
> has an active tracking session"*. **That was wrong**, and it collapsed the two
> privacy gates that the platform deliberately keeps apart.
>
> The live position is persisted and broadcast when the agent's **Tracking
> Allow** is on, and on **no other condition**
> (`session/service/service.go:492`, `Persist: pres.Device.TrackingAllow()`).
> Tracking Allow means `trackingEnabled == true` **and** neither
> `locationEnabled` nor `locationPermissionGranted` explicitly `false`.
>
> **An opted-in agent with no delivery at all returns a position here.** That is
> the designed behaviour, not a leak: reading an idle agent's position is how the
> platform finds the one nearest a pickup.
>
> The **durable GPS trail** is the gate that needs a shipment — see
> [gps-persistence.md](./gps-persistence.md). Do not reason about one from the
> other.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `200` | Position (or `null` if none is current) |
| `401` | Missing/invalid token |
| `404` | Not authorized to see this agent — deliberately indistinguishable from "no such agent", so the endpoint never confirms an agent's existence to someone who may not see them |
| `500` | Lookup failed |
| `502` | Could not verify authorization (jovi-mall unreachable) — fails closed |
