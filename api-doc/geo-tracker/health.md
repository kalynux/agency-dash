# Health & Metrics

**Verified against source on 2026-09-08** — both probes and all 23 metric names against
`geo-tracker/internal/modules/health/` and `internal/platform/metrics/metrics.go`. **Two defects
fixed**: the `503` example showed a raw checker error that Phase 16 replaced with the constant
`"unavailable"`, and the metrics table listed 7 of 23 series.

## Authentication

None — orchestrators and scrapers don't carry a bearer token.

---

### GET /healthz

**Liveness.** Returns `200` as long as the process can answer HTTP. Checks
nothing downstream, deliberately: a liveness failure tells an orchestrator to
restart the process, which would not fix a Redis/Postgres/jovi-mall outage —
that's what `/readyz` is for.

**Response** (`200`, `text/plain`): `ok`

---

### GET /readyz

**Readiness.** Runs every registered checker and returns `200` only if all pass.

**Response** (`200`):
```json
{ "redis": "ok", "postgres": "ok", "node_api": "ok" }
```

**Response** (`503`) — a failing checker reports the literal string `"unavailable"`
in place of `"ok"`:
```json
{
  "redis": "ok",
  "postgres": "ok",
  "node_api": "unavailable"
}
```

> ⚠ **`"unavailable"` is the only failure value, and that is deliberate.** Until
> Phase 16 this endpoint returned the checker's raw error — which named the
> Postgres host and database, and could embed up to 4 KB of jovi-mall's own
> response body — on an endpoint that is **unauthenticated**. The key already
> says which dependency failed; *why* is an operator's question and is answered
> in the log line, not on the wire. Do not parse this value for a cause, and do
> not build a UI that expects one.

| Checker | Verifies |
|---|---|
| `redis` | `PING` against `REDIS_URL` |
| `postgres` | `Ping` against `POSTGRES_URL` |
| `node_api` | `GET {NODE_API_BASE_URL}{NODE_API_HEALTH_PATH}` (default `/api/health`) |

> Two worth knowing: **`location_suppressed_total`** counts fixes accepted from the socket and
> not persisted because the agent has not granted Tracking Allow — read it against
> `location_updates_total`, or a low update rate cannot distinguish "nobody is driving" from
> "everybody has tracking switched off". And **`tracking_sessions_opened/closed`** count
> *shipments tracked, not sockets*, so a reconnect moves neither.
